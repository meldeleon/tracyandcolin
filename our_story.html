            Tracy and Colin met in the beginning of 2013 on their co-ed soccer team. Tracy remembers Colin being a cute, quiet, and shy guy. Colin remembers Tracy being a cute, outgoing, and friendly girl (he also secretly hoped she was single). Over the course of several months and many soccer games won and lost, Colin and Tracy started talking more and hanging out.</p>
        <p>When they started dating, Colin was a little hesitant due to Tracy's fierce and protective (his words) Bichon-poodle mix, Cami. He had never grown up with dogs and didn't know what to make of her. After feeding Cami many greenies and giving her lots of belly rubs, Colin won her over. While he was winning Cami's affection, he also won Tracy's. They were soon spending all their time together and realized this was the real deal. This family of 3 have been inseparable ever since and can't wait to the tie the knot!</p>
