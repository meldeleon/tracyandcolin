                <h2> Sherrie Chen </h2>
                <p> Tracy and Sherrie first met in 2011 at a quaint little office space on 410 Townsend Street in San Francisco. Within the first year of working together, the pair of young starry-eyed ladies quickly bonded over 3PM snack time, puppies, fine (and not so fine) wine, and basically everything that is LIFE. Since then these two have become inseparable and have been there for each other through the toughest times to the happiest moments. Enter Colin...
                    <br> From Day 1, Colin knew that dating Tracy was going to be a packaged deal. Taking Tracy on an adventure, meant that Sherrie (and Wayne) would sometimes, nay often, tag along. And so it was true. These friends have conquered the world together — from the glistening beaches of Santorini to the crazy streets of Tokyo to the cobblestones of Stockholm. Their adventures eventually brought them to the magical moment when Colin asked for Tracy’s hand. Sherrie is honored to be a part of this auspicious event and cannot wait to create a million more memories and adventures with Tracy, Colin, and Cami. . </p>

                <p> Arisa and Tracy first met while they were both working at Yammer. What really started their friendship was an amazing trip to Japan with 4 other girls; what brought them truly close was a boy named Colin. Arisa happened to know Colin (just a little bit) from college but hadn't seen him in years. One day, at a BBQ many summers ago, they reconnected. That turned into a Napa trip with Colin, Tracy, Arisa and others. Soon after, Tracy and Colin became a couple – and from there on out, the three have enjoyed many adventures together with Cami. Arisa is excited to be a part of this wedding and to celebrate #cracyinlove.</p>

                <p> Tracy and Katie met at UC Davis in 2008. Tracy was over at Katie's house visiting her roommate, when Katie asked Tracy to have coffee. From there, a great friendship was born including a total of almost 4 years of living together- 1 year in Davis and 3 years in San Francisco. Katie is pretty sure she is Tracy's all time favorite roommate :) After living together for a year in college, they also realized that Tracy's maternal grandparents and Katie's paternal grandma grew up together in San Francisco and were also great friends. It brought Katie's Grandma back in touch with Tracy's family and now they attend each other's family gatherings. Katie cannot wait to be part of Tracy and Colin's special day! </p>

                <p>Madelaine and Tracy met in college through mutual friends. They bonded instantly over group hangouts, spa dates, and romantic walks with Cami where they would catch up on girl talk. Countless nights they spent on the couch, sharing and listening to each others life stories. Through thick and thin, they have been by each others side. Madelaine could not be happier to be by Tracy's side and sharing this special day they've been talking about since college.</p>

                <p>Tracy and Robin first met back in 2012 when Tracy interviewed Robin for a job at Yammer. They quickly became friends and for the next couple of years created memories while at Yammer, Microsoft, and throughout their many travels together. Somewhere along the way, the two (and Cami) started a Monday night ritual of watching the Bachelor / Bachelorette. It wasn't long until Colin would join in on these nights and it would become a weekly tradition they all could share. Though it has been fun watching others on TV in their journey to find love, it has been an even better experience for Robin to witness Colin and Tracy's journey unfold. Robin is so honored and excited to be a part of their special day and to know that Colin is so deserving of Tracy's final rose.</p>

                <p>Dana and Tracy's friendship goes way back to their college days in Davis. Together they enjoyed adventures in Tahoe, girls trips to Las Vegas, eating sushi and watching "Say Yes Dress". Dana couldn't be happier that Tracy has said "Yes" to the perfect dress and will say "Yes" to her perfect man later this year.

Throughout their friendship they've enjoyed brunching, shopping and swapping stories about their fur babies (shout out to Max and Cami!). Since their Davis days have come to a close, Nissa and Tracy remain close as they each go through life's milestones hundreds of miles apart. Nissa could not be more excited for Tracy and wishes the happy couple a lifetime of happiness! </p>

                <p> Colin's younger sister, Karynn, grew up with him in Sacramento. Colin has found memories of the two of them sharing their candy loot on many Halloween nights and how they would trade each other for the best pieces of candy. Karynn actually remembers these "trades" differently where her older brother somehow convinces her to give him all her candy. Although they went to school on opposite coasts, they re-joined forces in 2013 and moved to San Francisco with their cousin, Casey. Shortly after moving, Karynn witnessed firsthand how Colin met and fell for Tracy (and then Cami) to the backdrop of the wild beauty of the Presidio. She is excited to welcome Tracy (and Cami) to the family! </p>

                <p> Kelvin and Colin met in 9th grade, second period Spanish with Mr. Jimenez. Kelvin was the new cool kid from a different elementary school so it was only natural that Colin sought out his friendship. Over the years, they became pals venturing in the great outdoors. Skiing/snowboarding at Kirkwood in the winter and camping trips in the summer. Colin, Ryan, Derek and Kelvin hang out frequently over competitive board games, where they catch up over beer and pizza rolls. They desperately try to win but they frequently fall short to Kelvin a.k.a. THE CHAMP. Kelvin is honored to share at Colin's special day as his best man. </p>

                <p> Colin and Casey have known each other for 27 years, 10 months, 7 days....and counting. Growing up, these two cousins had a lot of fun times at their family reunions in Seattle. When they were kids, Casey would repeatedly bug his cooler, older cousin Colin, by jumping on him while he was still asleep and pulling his ears so he would wake up and play. Years later Casey was bummed when Colin moved out of their apartment in the Presidio to live with Tracy. At the same time, Casey knew this had to be the real deal and it turns out he was right. He couldn't be more excited to be part of Colin's special day! </p>

Through their mutual appreciation for beer, whiskey, golf, and cooking, they've had many memorable moments. Their friendship goes beyond the fun times too (the aftermaths of dancing at Raven and hanging out at Dear Mom's); they have always been there to help each other through those rough times! </p>

Through middle school and high school, Colin and Kenny remained the closest friends who went through a lot of first time experiences together. They had their fun playing poker, attending house parties, some video game action and more poker. Living in different states, it is seldom they get a chance to see each other, but when they do, food and beer is in order.</p>

He still can't say room, little did he know....That he would ask Derek to be his groomsman, and Derek said "Yes I will, I would be honored." And now he can't wait, to celebrate their big day. </p>
